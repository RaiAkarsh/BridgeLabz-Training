## 📅 Training Timeline

### 📆 **01 January 2026**
Started OOPS practice by understanding the basics of classes and objects.

**Work Done:**
- Created classes and objects  
- Understood object creation and method calling  

🔗 **[Class & Object](https://github.com/RaiAkarsh/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/oops-practice/gcr-codebase/class-and-object)**

---

### 📆 **02 January 2026**
Focused on constructors and object initialization.

**Work Done:**
- Implemented constructors  
- Learned instance creation using constructors  

🔗 **[Constructor & Instance](https://github.com/RaiAkarsh/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/oops-practice/gcr-codebase/constructor-and-instance)**

---

### 📆 **03 January 2026**
Learned about commonly used OOPS keywords.

**Work Done:**
- Used `this` keyword  
- Practiced `static` members  
- Implemented `final` keyword  

🔗 **[This / Static / Final](https://github.com/RaiAkarsh/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/oops-practice/gcr-codebase/this-static-final)**

---

### 📆 **04 January 2026**
Worked on inheritance concepts.

**Work Done:**
- Implemented inheritance using `extends`  
- Practiced code reusability  

🔗 **[Inheritance](https://github.com/RaiAkarsh/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/oops-practice/gcr-codebase/inheritance)**

---

### 📆 **05 January 2026**
Focused on core OOPS principles.

**Work Done:**
- Implemented encapsulation using getters and setters  
- Practiced polymorphism and method overriding  

🔗 **[Encapsulation & Polymorphism](https://github.com/RaiAkarsh/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/oops-practice/gcr-codebase/encapsulation-polymorphism)**

---

### 📆 **06 January 2026**
Learned object interaction and design representation.

**Work Done:**
- Studied class diagrams  
- Worked with object and sequence diagrams  

🔗 **[Class & Object Diagrams](https://github.com/RaiAkarsh/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/oops-practice/gcr-codebase/class-object-sequence-diagram)**

---

### 📆 **07 January 2026**
Applied OOPS concepts to logic-based and real-world problems.

**Work Done:**
- Solved Java logic problems  
- Worked on scenario-based programs  

🔗 **[LeetCode Practice](https://github.com/RaiAkarsh/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/oops-practice/leet-code-codebase)**
